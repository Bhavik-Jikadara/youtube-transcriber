# Youtube Transcriber

- The **YouTube Transcript to Detailed Summary Converter** is a powerful tool designed to help users quickly grasp the key points of a YouTube video without needing to watch the entire content. This tool extracts the transcript of a YouTube video and uses advanced text analysis techniques to condense it into a shorter, more manageable summary.

## How it works

- **Input YouTube Video URL**: Paste the YouTube video URL into the application.
- **Transcript Extraction**: The tool will automatically extract the transcript using the provided closed captions or generate it via speech-to-text.
- **Summary Generation**: Once the transcript is processed, the tool will create a detailed summary, highlighting the key points of the video.
- **View or Download Summary**: The summary can be viewed directly in the application or downloaded as a text file.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the YouTube Transcript to Detailed Summary Converter on your local machine.

1. First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. This will download all the necessary files and folders for the project.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bhavik-Jikadara/youtube-transcriber.git
    cd youtube-transcriber
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. This step ensures that all required packages are installed in an isolated environment.

    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/Script/activate
    ```

    `Note: On macOS/Linux, use source venv/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment.`

3. With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. These dependencies include the libraries required for transcript extraction and text summarization.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

After completing these steps, you’ll have the project set up and ready to use!
